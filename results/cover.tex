\justifying

"I am a dynamic professional with a Master's in Public Administration and over three years of experience in policy analysis, sustainability reporting, and project management. With a strong foundation in regulatory compliance, lifecycle assessment, and policy analysis, I am excited about the opportunity to join WBCSD as an Associate in the Equity Action team.

Having honed my skills in data analysis using tools like Excel and PowerBI, I am adept at translating complex policies and reporting standards into actionable strategies. My experience in stakeholder management and project coordination, combined with my proficiency in MS Excel, QGIS, and SimaPro, make me well-equipped to support member coordination within BCTI and manage online and potentially in-person events.

With a proactive approach, excellent communication skills, and a track record of delivering impactful results, I am eager to contribute to WBCSD's mission of accelerating progress within member value chains and organizations to shape markets where social performance and accountability are paramount. My passion for sustainability and commitment to driving positive change align well with the values of WBCSD.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my background and skills can add value to the Equity Action team at WBCSD."
