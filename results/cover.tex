\justifying

I am a dedicated professional with a passion for policy and over three years of experience in policymaking, compliance, regulations, communications, and project management. Skilled in designing and implementing policies with risk mitigation techniques, I have a comprehensive understanding of governance and compliance patterns. My experience includes conducting extensive policy analysis, corrections, and maintaining strong stakeholder communication. I am eager to contribute to the mission of creating impactful communication strategies. 

I have utilized analytical tools like Excel and PowerBI to analyze financial fronts of policies, their impact, deficits, and how they could be bridged. I have used management tools like Trello and Asana to collaborate with stakeholders for timely deliverables. I have conducted lifecycle assessments for assignments using SimaPro to understand the circular economy and calculate GHG emissions. My experience in international and multicultural contexts, coupled with strong interpersonal skills, makes me confident in engaging with EU institutions, businesses, and civil society. My proactive approach and proven track record in sustainability and policy analysis align well with the responsibilities of this role.
